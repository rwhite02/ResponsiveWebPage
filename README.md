# ResponsiveWebPage

This repository is built on my previous project, which was just to create a simple Markdown webpage with limited interaction features. In this repository, I included aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to make the previously made Markdown webpage much more interactive and functional. 

I made the necessary edits to the website that was asked specifically in the instructions, and for the 3 additional customized styles I created a dropdown menu in the "See Also" section in the navbar, I added in-image text captions to each image, and I added an element that creates a button that when pressed, brings the viewer back to the top of the page after they've scrolled to the bottom.
